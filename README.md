## Notes:
For part 1, my `POST` and `PUT` do not create `prefligt` request, but my `DELETE` does. I asked Professor Powell during
his office hours, and he said that `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` all supposed to create a `preflight` request. He went
over my code and tried my demo, but we could not figure out why my `POST` and `PUT` are not doing it whereas my `DELETE` does.
He said it is okay for now, but I am still wondering why they are not creating `preflight` request.
